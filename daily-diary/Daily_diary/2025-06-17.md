**Project focus:** Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision

## Goals for today
- Understand the core components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

- Learn about the function of each layer in a CNN.

- Solidify my understanding of how CNNs process image data.
## Tasks completed
- Studied the key components of CNNs : Â  

- **Convolutional Layers**: Learned how filters detect features like edges and patterns.

- **Pooling Layers**: Understood their role in down-sampling and reducing spatial dimensions.

- **Activation Functions**: Reviewed how they introduce non-linearity.

- **Fully Connected Layers**: Learned how they perform the final classification.

- Sketched out a simple CNN architecture to visualize the data flow.

## Challenges & learnings
- The concept of hierarchical feature learning in CNNs is fascinatingâ€”how the network learns simple features and combines them to form complex patterns.

- It's clear why CNNs are the standard for image tasks; their architecture is inherently designed to process spatial data.

## Plan for tomorrow
Study the MobileNetV2 architecture, which is highly relevant for our goal of mobile deployment.
