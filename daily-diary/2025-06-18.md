**Project focus:** Studying Efficient Model Architectures

## Goals for today
Read and understand the MobileNetV2 research paper. Â  

Grasp the key innovations that make MobileNetV2 efficient.

Document my notes on its architecture for future reference.

## Tasks completed
- Read the paper "MobileNetV2: Inverted - - - Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks". Â  

- Took detailed notes on its core concepts : Â  

- - Inverted Residuals: How the model uses narrow input/output layers and expands data in intermediate layers.

- - Linear Bottlenecks: The use of linear layers to prevent information loss.

- - Depthwise Separable Convolutions: Understood how this technique significantly reduces computational cost.

- Learned that MobileNetV2 is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which will be crucial for transfer learning. Â  

## Challenges & learnings
- The architectural trade-offs to achieve efficiency are brilliant.

- This architecture seems perfect for our project's goal of creating a lightweight, mobile-friendly application.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Study another state-of-the-art architecture: EfficientNet.
