## Project focus: Investigating and Quantifying Class Imbalance

## Goals for today
- Write a script to count the number of images in each class for the tomato dataset.

- Visualize the class distribution using a bar chart.

- Research techniques for handling class imbalance in deep learning.

## Tasks completed
- The script confirmed a severe class imbalance. Some classes have over 1,000 images, while others have fewer than 100.

- Created a bar chart that clearly visualizes this disparity.

- Researched two primary techniques to solve this: Oversampling and Undersampling. Â  

## Challenges & learnings
- Data quality and preparation are just as important, if not more so, than the model architecture itself.

- Addressing this data issue is now the top priority for the project.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Expand the scope of data collection to all five target crops (corn, grape, mango, peanut, tomato).
