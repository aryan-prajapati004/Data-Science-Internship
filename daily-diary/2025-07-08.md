**Project focus:**
- Evaluating Model Deployment Constraints

## Goals for today
- Finalize the training of the custom CNN and evaluate its performance.
- Compare the results of EfficientNet-B0 and the custom CNN.
- Analyze the size of the saved EfficientNet-B0 model.

## Tasks completed
- The custom CNN achieved a validation accuracy of only 85%, significantly lower than EfficientNet-B0.  
- The comparison is clear: transfer learning is vastly superior.  
- Checked the file size of the saved EfficientNet-B0 model â€” around 15 MB.

## Challenges & learnings
- While 15 MB is not huge, for a mobile app a smaller model is preferable.  
- The project goal is a *mobile-friendly* solution, so model size matters.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Make a final decision on the model architecture. Pivot to MobileNetV2 as the primary model.
