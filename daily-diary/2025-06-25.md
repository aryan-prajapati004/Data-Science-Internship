## Project focus: Initial Data Collection - Tomato Dataset

## Goals for today
- Find and download a suitable dataset for tomato plant diseases.

- Explore the dataset to understand its structure, classes, and image quality.

- Preprocess the data and load it into the Colab notebook.

## Tasks completed
- Sourced a tomato disease dataset from public repositories (PlantVillage, Mendeley Data). Â  

- The dataset contains 10 classes, including 9 diseases and one 'healthy' class. Â  

- Wrote a script to load the images and display samples for each class.

- Noticed that the number of images per class is highly variable, indicating a class imbalance issue. Â  

## Challenges & learnings
- The quality of publicly available datasets can be inconsistent.

- The class imbalance is a potential issue that I'll need to address later.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Build and train the first transfer learning model using EfficientNet-Lite0 on the tomato dataset.
