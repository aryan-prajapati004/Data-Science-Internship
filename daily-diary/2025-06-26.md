## Project focus: First Transfer Learning Experiment

## Goals for today
- Implement a transfer learning pipeline using EfficientNet-Lite0.

- Load the pre-trained model and add a new classification head for the 10 tomato classes.

- Start the training process on the tomato dataset.

## Tasks completed
- Wrote the TensorFlow/Keras code to load EfficientNet-Lite0 with ImageNet weights. Â  

- Froze the base model layers to use them as feature extractors.

- Added a new classification head.

- Compiled the model and started the training process.

## Challenges & learnings
- The training is incredibly slow. Each epoch is taking much longer than expected, even on a GPU.

- The GPU utilization seems low, suggesting a bottleneck or a configuration issue.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Debug the slow training issue. Investigate the cause and find a solution.
