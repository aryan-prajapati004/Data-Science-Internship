## Project focus: Real-World Testing and Identifying Overfitting

## Goals for today
- Find a set of real-world tomato leaf images not from the original dataset.

- Write a script to load the trained model and make predictions on these new images.

- Analyze the model's performance and identify any issues.

## Tasks completed
- Collected 20-30 new images of tomato diseases from various online sources.

- Wrote a prediction script to classify the new images.

- The model performed poorly on these images, frequently making incorrect predictions. This indicates overfitting. Â  

## Challenges & learnings
- The model is clearly overfitting to the training dataset. It has learned the specific characteristics of the dataset images but fails to generalize.

- The root cause is likely the class imbalance I noticed earlier. The model is biased towards the majority classes. Â  

## Plan for tomorrow
- Begin a thorough investigation into the class distribution of the tomato dataset.
