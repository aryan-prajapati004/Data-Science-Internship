**Project focus:** *Literature Review* - Understanding the Problem Domain

## Goals for today
- Study the economic impact of plant diseases in India.

- Understand the limitations of traditional disease detection methods.

- Begin exploring how AI, specifically computer vision, can address this problem.

## Tasks completed
- Read and summarized a report from CropLife India, noting the significant annual economic losses due to pests and diseases. Â  

- Reviewed articles on manual disease inspection, noting its reliance on experts, which is often slow and inaccessible for many farmers. Â  

- Skimmed foundational papers on the use of Deep Learning for agricultural applications.

## Challenges & learnings
- The scale of the problem is immense. An effective AI solution could have a massive socio-economic impact.

- Realized the importance of creating a solution that is not just accurate but also accessible and easy to use for farmers.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Dive deeper into the core technology: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

- Study the fundamental architecture of CNNs.
