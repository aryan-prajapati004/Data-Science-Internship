**Project focus:**
- Training Individual Models & Weekly Mentor Update

## Goals for today
- Train the *Rice* model (4 classes) and *Tomato* model (10 classes).
- Prepare and conduct the weekly progress update.

## Tasks completed
- Trained the Rice model with excellent performance.  
- Trained the Tomato model, which was more complex but yielded good accuracy.  

- **Weekly Mentor Update:** *Shared results with Dr. Sandha, explaining the pivot to MobileNetV2 and individual model outcomes.*

## Challenges & learnings
- Tomato modelâ€™s many classes revealed the challenge of fine-grained classification.  
- Consolidated these findings for inclusion in the final report.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Train the final combined model with all 28 classes.
