## Project focus: Analyzing Initial Model Results

## Goals for today
- Complete the training of EfficientNet-B0 on the tomato dataset.

- Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.

- Plot the training/validation accuracy and loss curves.

## Tasks completed
- The model finished training.

- Achieved a very high validation accuracy of approximately 96%. Â  

- Plotted the learning curves using Matplotlib. The curves show that the model learned well.

## Challenges & learnings
- A 96% validation accuracy is a fantastic result for a first proper run. Transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 is clearly very effective.

- However, high validation accuracy on a dataset from a single source doesn't always translate to good real-world performance.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Test the model on new, unseen images of tomato leaves sourced from the internet to check its real-world generalization.
