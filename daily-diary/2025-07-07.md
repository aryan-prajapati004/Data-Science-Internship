**Project focus:**
- Comparative Modeling â€“ Custom CNN

## Goals for today
- Analyze the performance of EfficientNet-B0 on the balanced dataset.
- Design and implement a custom CNN architecture from scratch.
- Start training the custom CNN on the balanced dataset.

## Tasks completed
- The EfficientNet-B0 model finished training and achieved excellent results (~94% validation accuracy).  
- Designed a simple custom CNN with a few convolutional and pooling layers.  
- Started the training process for the custom CNN.

## Challenges & learnings
- The performance of EfficientNet-B0 confirms the power of transfer learning.  
- The custom CNN will serve as a baseline to quantitatively demonstrate the benefit of transfer learning in my final report.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Finalize the custom CNN training and compare its performance directly with EfficientNet-B0.
