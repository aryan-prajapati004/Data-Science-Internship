**Project focus:**
- Generating High-Level Evaluation Metrics

## Goals for today
- Evaluate all trained models on test sets.  
- Calculate validation loss and accuracy for each.  
- Compile results into a summary table.

## Tasks completed
- Ran evaluation script for all six models.  
- Created markdown table summarizing results (Table 3.1 in report).  
- Combined model achieved 95.15% validation accuracy.

## Challenges & learnings
- Validation confirms strong end-to-end workflow.  
- Learned markdown table formatting for inclusion in report.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Generate detailed classification reports (Precision, Recall, F1).
