**Project focus:**
- Detailed Per-Class Performance Analysis

## Goals for today
- Generate classification reports for each model.  
- Analyze per-class Precision, Recall, and F1.  
- Visualize results with bar charts.

## Tasks completed
- Used scikit-learnâ€™s classification_report for detailed metrics.  
- Created metric tables (Tables 3.2â€“3.7).  
- Wrote matplotlib script to produce bar charts (Figures 3.1â€“3.5).

## Challenges & learnings
- Detailed metrics reveal per-class weaknesses.  
- Learned exporting high-resolution plots for PDF use.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Generate and analyze confusion matrices.
