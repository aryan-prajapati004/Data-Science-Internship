**Project focus:**
- Training Individual Models â€“ Corn

## Goals for today
- Implement the two-phase training strategy for MobileNetV2.
- Train the *Corn* model (4 classes).
- Save the trained model and its training history.

## Tasks completed
- Implemented two-phase training:  
  **Phase 1 (Feature Extraction):** froze the base and trained the new classification head for 25 epochs.  
  **Phase 2 (Fine-Tuning):** unfroze the top 30 layers and continued for another 10 epochs with a lower learning rate.  
- Trained successfully on the corn subset with high accuracy.

## Challenges & learnings
- The staged fine-tuning approach stabilizes learning and avoids overfitting.  
- BatchNorm layers must remain frozen during fine-tuning for stability.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Train the *Sugarcane* and *pepper* models using the same two-phase strategy.
