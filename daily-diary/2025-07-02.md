## Project focus: Expanding Data Collection to All Crops

## Goals for today
- Systematically download datasets for the remaining four crops: corn, grape, mango, and peanut.

- Organize all datasets into a consistent folder structure.

- Perform an initial class distribution analysis for all crops.

## Tasks completed
- Downloaded datasets for corn,pepper,wheat, and chili from Plantvillage Dataset and other sources. Â  

- Organized the data into a root folder with subdirectories for each crop and disease class.

- Ran the analysis script on all datasets. As expected, they all suffer from significant class imbalance.

## Challenges & learnings
- Managing a large dataset (over 31,000 images) requires careful organization. Â  

- The problem of class imbalance is consistent across all available public datasets for this task.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Begin implementing the data balancing strategy. Start with the oversampling script.
