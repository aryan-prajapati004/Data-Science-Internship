**Project focus:**
- Visualizing Model Confusion

## Goals for today
- Generate confusion matrices for Tomato and combined models.  
- Use heatmaps to visualize misclassifications.

## Tasks completed
- Created matrices via sklearn and seaborn.heatmap.  
- Found confusion among similar Tomato diseases (Early/Late Blight).  
- Combined model shows most confusion within same-crop classes.

## Challenges & learnings
- Confusion matrices expose specific weaknesses.  
- Essential for the ‚ÄúResults & Discussion‚Äù chapter.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Begin writing internship report (Introduction chapter).
