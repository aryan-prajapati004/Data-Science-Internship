**Project focus:**
- Training Individual Models â€“ Suagrcane & Pepper

## Goals for today
- Train the *Suagrcane* model (4 classes).  
- Train the *Pepper* model (6 classes).  
- Systematically save the models and their results.

## Tasks completed
- Adapted the training script for the grape dataset and completed full two-phase training with excellent results.  
- Repeated the same process for the peanut dataset with similarly strong performance.  
- Organized the output models and result plots into separate folders.

## Challenges & learnings
- The pipeline is now robust and repeatable across crops.  
- Crops with fewer, distinct diseases tend to yield slightly better accuracy.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Complete the individual model training for the *Mango* and *Tomato* datasets.
