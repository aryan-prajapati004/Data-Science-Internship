**Project focus:**
- Implementing Data Balancing â€“ Undersampling

## Goals for today
- Add the undersampling logic to the data balancing script.
- Run the complete script on the entire multi-crop dataset.
- Verify that the final dataset is perfectly balanced.

## Tasks completed
- Added a function to the script for undersampling. For any class with more than 1200 images, it randomly deletes excess images.  
- Created a new directory `data/processed/balanced_dataset` for the output.  
- Executed the full script. It took several hours to process all 28 classes across the 5 crops.  
- Ran a verification script at the end, which confirmed that every single class now has exactly 1200 images.

## Challenges & learnings
- This process created a high-quality, balanced dataset of 33,600 images.  
- This dataset is now one of the key assets of my project.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Upload the balanced dataset to Kaggle to ensure reproducibility.
