**Project focus:**
- Implementing Data Balancing â€“ Oversampling

## Goals for today
- Write a Python script to perform oversampling on the minority classes.
- Use data augmentation techniques (rotation) to create new synthetic images.
- Set a target number of images per class (1200).

## Tasks completed
- Wrote a script using OpenCV and Pillow to process the images.  
- For any class with fewer than 1200 images, the script randomly selects an image, applies a random rotation (90Â°, 180Â°, or 270Â°), and saves it as a new file.  
- This process is repeated until the class reaches the target of 1200 images.

## Challenges & learnings
- It's important to use simple, label-preserving augmentations for oversampling.  
- This script will take a while to run on the entire dataset, so efficiency matters.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Implement the undersampling part of the strategy and run the full balancing pipeline.
