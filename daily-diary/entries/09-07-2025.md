**Project focus:** AI Plant Disease Detection

## Goals for today
- Deepen understanding of CNN architecture (convolution, pooling, activations).  
- Implement a basic CNN from scratch in PyTorch.  
- Validate the implementation on a small sample of leaf images.

## Tasks completed
- Studied convolutional layer mechanics, kernel sizes, padding, and stride effects.  
- Created `projects/plant-disease-detection/notebooks/03-cnn-implementation.ipynb` with:
  - Convolution, ReLU, and maxâ€‘pooling examples.  
  - Flattening and fully connected layers.  
  - Overfit test on 50 images (achieved ~95% train accuracy).  
- Extended `projects/plant-disease-detection/src/model.py` to include a `SimpleCNN` class prototype.  

## Challenges & learnings
- Faced shapeâ€‘mismatch errors when transitioning from conv outputs to dense layersâ€”learned to calculate output dimensions precisely.  
- Discovered how padding choices affect feature map size and edge information.  
- Gained handsâ€‘on practice debugging PyTorch tensor shapes and parameters.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Integrate `SimpleCNN` into `train.py` and run on full training set.  
- Experiment with varying filter counts and layer depths to improve generalization.  
- Visualize intermediate feature maps to interpret what the CNN is learning.
