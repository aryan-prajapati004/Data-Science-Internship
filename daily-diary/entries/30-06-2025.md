**Project focus:** AI Plant Disease Detection

## Goals for today
- Collect raw plant‚Äêdisease image dataset.
- Perform data cleaning: remove corrupt/duplicate images.
- Apply basic preprocessing (resize, normalize).

## Tasks completed
- Downloaded and organized 5,000+ leaf images into  
  `projects/plant-disease-detection/data/raw/`.
- Wrote `projects/plant-disease-detection/src/data_clean.py` to:
  - Detect and remove corrupted image files.
  - Identify and drop duplicate images via checksums.
  - Resize all images to 224√ó224 pixels.
  - Normalize pixel values to [0,1].
- Updated `projects/plant-disease-detection/data/processed/` with cleaned outputs.
- Noted file counts and class distribution in a quick pandas-based script.

## Challenges & learnings
- Encountered ~2% corrupted files‚Äîlearned to catch PIL `UnidentifiedImageError`.
- Found slight class imbalances; documented counts for ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù vs. specific disease classes.
- Gained practice writing robust file‚Äêhandling routines in Python.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Perform exploratory data analysis on cleaned dataset (class distributions, sample visualization).
- Write a data‚Äêloader class in `src/dataloader.py` for PyTorch ingestion.
- Begin a small-scale overfit test on 100‚Äêimage subset.
