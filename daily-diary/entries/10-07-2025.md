**Project focus:** AI Plant Disease Detection

## Goals for today
- Understand the fundamentals of image classification using deep learning.
- Learn how CNNs are used to classify images into predefined categories.
- Apply image classification on a plant disease dataset.

## Tasks completed
- Studied the complete pipeline of image classification: input â†’ feature extraction â†’ classification.  
- Explored popular architectures like LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet for image classification tasks.  
- Implemented a basic CNN-based classifier using PyTorch on a small subset of plant leaf images.  
- Achieved initial accuracy of ~85% on 3 classes (Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight).

## Challenges & learnings
- Understood how softmax and cross-entropy loss work in multi-class classification.  
- Faced difficulty tuning learning rate and batch size; improved results after experimentation.  
- Learned about overfitting in small datasets and how regularization (dropout, data augmentation) helps.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Expand the model to handle all classes in the dataset.  
- Implement data augmentation to increase model robustness.  
- Add performance evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
