**Project focus:** AI Plant Disease Detection

## Goals for today
- Review and refine the project report created yesterday.
- Add a brief literature review and summary of related work.
- Organize files and folders in the project repository.

## Tasks completed
- Edited and updated `project_report.pdf` with a proper abstract, introduction, and related work section.
- Added citations from key research papers using IEEE format.
- Organized the `projects/plant-disease-detection/` folder:
  - Moved charts and outputs to a new `reports/figures/` subfolder.
  - Cleaned unused scripts and added comments to `train.py`.
- Updated `README.md` with clearer instructions for setting up the environment and running the model.

## Challenges & learnings
- Learned to properly format academic citations using Google Scholar and BibTeX.
- Faced difficulty structuring the ‚ÄúRelated Work‚Äù section concisely; reviewed 3 reference papers and summarized key points.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Start working on model evaluation metrics and visualize performance (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix).
- Set up basic logging for training using Matplotlib and/or TensorBoard.
