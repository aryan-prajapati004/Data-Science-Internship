**Project focus:**
- Training the Combined Multi-Crop Model

## Goals for today
- Adapt the training script for the full 28-class dataset.  
- Increase the number of epochs for both training phases.  
- Start the long training run for the combined model.

## Tasks completed
- Configured data loader for all 28 classes.  
- Set 15 epochs for feature extraction and 15 for fine-tuning.  
- Started training and monitored via TensorBoard.

## Challenges & learnings
- Larger datasets require careful monitoring to prevent overfitting.  
- This run will validate MobileNetV2â€™s generalization ability.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Evaluate the combined model once training completes.
