**Project focus:**
- Training on the Full Balanced Dataset

## Goals for today
- Set up a new training notebook for the full 28-class dataset.
- Load the balanced dataset using Kerasâ€™s ImageDataGenerator.
- Train the EfficientNet-B0 model on this new dataset.

## Tasks completed
- Created `notebooks/06-training-efficientnetb0-balanced.ipynb`.  
- Used ImageDataGenerator to create training and validation splits and apply on-the-fly data augmentation.  
- Started the training process for EfficientNet-B0 on all 28 classes.

## Challenges & learnings
- Training on a larger, more diverse dataset requires more epochs to converge.  
- Monitoring validation accuracy closely is key to see if the data balancing has solved the overfitting problem.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Analyze the results of the EfficientNet-B0 training run and start a comparative experiment with a custom CNN.
