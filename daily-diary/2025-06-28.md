## Project focus: Retraining with a Compatible Model & Weekly Mentor Update

## Goals for today
- Modify the training script to use EfficientNet-B0.

- Re-run the training process on the tomato dataset.

- Prepare and conduct the weekly progress update.

## Tasks completed
- Replaced EfficientNet-Lite0 with tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0 in the code. Â  

- Re-launched the training. The difference was night and day; training is now significantly faster with high GPU utilization.

## Weekly Mentor Update: 
*During our weekly google meet , I updated Dr. Sandha on the project's progress. I explained the completion of the MNIST project, the setup of the main project environment, the challenge with the slow EfficientNet-Lite0 training, and demonstrated the successful resolution by switching to EfficientNet-B0. I followed up with a summary email.*

## Challenges & learnings
- Choosing the right tool for the job is crucial. A simple model swap solved a major technical roadblock.

- The initial frustration turned into a valuable learning experience about checking model compatibility.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Let the EfficientNet-B0 model train to completion and analyze the results.
