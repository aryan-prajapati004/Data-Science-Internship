**Project focus:**
- Strategic Pivot to MobileNetV2

## Goals for today
- Justify and document the decision to switch to MobileNetV2.
- Refactor the training pipeline to use MobileNetV2 as the base model.
- Plan the final set of experiments.

## Tasks completed
- Wrote a memo outlining the rationale for switching â€” MobileNetV2 is optimized for mobile devices and keeps models under 10 MB.  
- Created a new training notebook template for MobileNetV2.  
- Outlined the final plan: train one MobileNetV2 model for each crop and one combined model.

## Challenges & learnings
- This decision optimizes for deployment, not just accuracy.  
- Selecting the right model for the system context is a key engineering judgment.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Implement the two-phase training strategy (feature extraction + fine-tuning) for MobileNetV2 and start training the *Corn* model.
