**Project focus:** Building a CNN from Scratch for MNIST

## Goals for today
- Set up the project structure for the MNIST CNN.

- Implement the forward pass for the key layers: Convolutional, Max-Pooling, and Softmax.

- Write the code to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.

## Tasks completed
- Created a new project directory projects/mnist-cnn-from-scratch.

- Implemented the forward pass for the Conv3x3, MaxPool2, and Softmax layer classes. Â  

- Wrote a helper function to load, normalize, and flatten the MNIST image data.

## Challenges & learnings
- Implementing the forward pass from scratch is a great way to truly understand what's happening under the hood of libraries like Keras.

- Keeping track of dimensions as data flows through the network is critical and requires careful coding.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Tackle the most challenging part: implementing the backward pass (backpropagation) for each layer.
