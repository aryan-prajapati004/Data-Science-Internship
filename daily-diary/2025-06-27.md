## Project focus: Debugging Model Training Performance

## Goals for today
- Diagnose the root cause of the slow training speed.

- Research potential compatibility issues with EfficientNet-Lite0.

- Formulate a plan to resolve the performance bottleneck.

## Tasks completed
- Monitored system resources during training and confirmed that the GPU was not being fully utilized.

- Researched online forums and TensorFlow documentation.

- Discovered the likely cause: EfficientNet-Lite0 is built for TensorFlow 1, and using it in a TensorFlow 2 environment can cause fallbacks to CPU operations, explaining the slowness. Â  

## Challenges & learnings
- This is a critical lesson in library and model versioning. Just because code runs without errors doesn't mean it's running efficiently.

- The solution is to pivot to a model architecture that is fully compatible with my environment.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Switch the model architecture to EfficientNet-B0, which is well-supported in TensorFlow 2.
