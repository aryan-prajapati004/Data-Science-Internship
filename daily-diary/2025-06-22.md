## Project focus: Training the Scratch CNN on MNIST

## Goals for today
- Finalize the backpropagation implementation for the convolutional layer.

- Write the main training loop to iterate through the data, perform forward/backward passes, and update weights.

- Run the first few training epochs and debug any issues.

## Tasks completed
- Completed the Conv3x3 backward pass implementation. Â  

- Wrote the training loop, including logic for iterating over epochs and mini-batches.

- Started the training process. The loss started decreasing and accuracy started increasing, which is a great sign that the backpropagation logic is correct. Â  

## Challenges & learnings
- Debugging backpropagation is tricky. A small error in the gradient calculation can prevent the network from learning entirely.

- Seeing the model learn from scratch is incredibly rewarding and provides a solid foundation before using high-level frameworks.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Continue training the MNIST model and evaluate its final performance.
