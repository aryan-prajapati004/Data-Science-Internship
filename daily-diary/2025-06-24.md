## Project focus: Setting Up the Project Environment

## Goals for today
- Create the main project repository for the Plant Disease Detection system.

- Set up a Google Colab notebook for the project.

- Learn to work with Google Colab, including mounting Google Drive and using GPU acceleration.

## Tasks completed
- Created a new private GitHub repository for the internship project.

- Set up a new Google Colab notebook, 01-initial-exploration.ipynb. Â  

- Practiced mounting my Google Drive to the Colab instance to access files persistently.

- Configured the notebook runtime to use the free GPU provided by Colab. Â  

- Installed necessary libraries like TensorFlow and Matplotlib.

## Challenges & learnings
- Google Colab is a powerful tool. Access to free GPU resources is a game-changer for training deep learning models.

- Managing file paths between Google Drive and the Colab environment requires careful organization.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Begin data collection. Start with a single crop (tomato) to simplify the initial experiments.
