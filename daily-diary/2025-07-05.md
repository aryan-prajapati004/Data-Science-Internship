**Project focus:**
- Publishing Dataset & Weekly Mentor Update

## Goals for today
- Create a new dataset on Kaggle.
- Compress and upload the balanced dataset.
- Prepare and conduct the weekly progress update.

## Tasks completed
- Created a new public dataset on Kaggle titled "Balanced Multi-Crop Plant Disease Dataset".  
- Zipped the entire dataset directory and uploaded it. Wrote a detailed data card explaining the methodology.  

- **Weekly Mentor Update:** *In our weekly google meet, I presented the overfitting issue discovered during real-world testing and my solution: the newly created balanced dataset. I shared the Kaggle link with Dr. Sandha and followed up with a detailed email report.*

## Challenges & learnings
- Sharing work openly on platforms like Kaggle is an important part of the data-science process.  
- The upload process for a large dataset can be slow and requires a stable connection.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Return to model training. I will train EfficientNet-B0 on the full, balanced dataset.
