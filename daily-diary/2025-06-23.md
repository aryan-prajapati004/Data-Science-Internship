## Project focus: Finalizing MNIST CNN Project

## Goals for today
- Complete the training of the MNIST CNN.

- Evaluate the model on the test set.

- Document the results and clean up the code.

## Tasks completed
- Trained the model for 10 full epochs. Â  

- Ran the model on the unseen test dataset and achieved a final test accuracy of 80.8%. Â  

- Added comments to the code and wrote a README.md file summarizing the project and its results.

## Challenges & learnings
- Achieving over 80% accuracy with a simple, from-scratch CNN is a great result and validates my understanding of the fundamentals.

- This "toy project" was invaluable. I now have a much deeper intuition for how these models work.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Officially start the main project. Set up the development environment on Google Colab.
