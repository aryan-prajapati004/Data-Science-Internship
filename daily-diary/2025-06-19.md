**Project focus:** Studying Advanced Model Scaling

## Goals for today
- Read and understand the EfficientNet research paper. Â  

- Learn about the concept of compound scaling.

- Compare the scaling philosophy of EfficientNet with MobileNet.

## Tasks completed
- Read the paper "EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks". Â  

- Understood the core idea of compound scaling: scaling network depth, width, and resolution uniformly. Â  

- Noted that EfficientNet-B0 provides a strong baseline with a good balance of accuracy and computational cost, making it a strong candidate for our project. Â  

## Challenges & learnings
- The systematic approach to model scaling in EfficientNet is a powerful concept.

- I now have a good understanding of two powerful, efficient architectures, which will be critical when I start building the actual model.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Transition from theory to practice. Start my first "toy project": building a CNN from scratch to classify MNIST digits.
